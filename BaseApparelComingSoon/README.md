## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

With this project I really wanted to test my **js** skills! One of the things I found most helpful was this really awesome gide that showed a great approach. (link below) Using this I created multiple functions and allowed for a slick and clean form validation system.


### Useful resources

- [Js Form Validation Tut](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-form-validation/) - This was a great guide to get started with form validation!
