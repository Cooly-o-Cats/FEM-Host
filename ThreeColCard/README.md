## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries for responsiveness

### What I learned
I learned a variety of things during this project. 
- First of all, I learned new ways to use CSS Selectors. Such as:
```css
.btn-text.sedan{
/* Properties */
}
.card-button:hover .btn-text{
/* Properties */
}
```
Which allow more specific selections on elements.

- Second, I learned that designing and coding mobile first allows for much easier time when creating breakpoints. And improving responsiveness on all devices!

### Continued development

Flex or "Flex Box" is always a good tool to use. When I started this project I thought I'd be using CSS Grid, but Flex was just the way to go. I plan to continue these challenges and improve my skills. As well as work with JS
